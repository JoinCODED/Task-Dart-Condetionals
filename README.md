### 🍋 Conditionals❓

Define an integer variable called `mark`.

Then print different results depending on these conditions:

```
if `mark` is more than or equal to 80
    print A
if `mark` is more than or equal to 70 and less than 80
    print B
if `mark` is more than or equal to 60 and less than 70
    print C
if `mark` is more than or equal to 50 but less than 60
    print D
otherwise
    print F
```

Then verify that the code works correctly for different values of `mark`.

### 🤼‍♂️ More Practice: FizzBuzz

Define an integer variable called `i`.

```
if i is divisible by 3 and 5
    print "fizz buzz"
if i is divisible by 3
    print "fizz"
if i is divisible by 5
    print "buzz"
otherwise
    print i
```

💡Hint: you'll need to use the integer modulo operator `%`.
